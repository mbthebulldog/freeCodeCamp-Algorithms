# freeCodeCamp-Algorithms
My original answers to the algorithm challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/mbthebulldog).

Feel free to refer to these to help you figure out your own way to solve the challenges whenever you get stuck, though I stronlgy encourage you to try to figure them out on your own first. I left comments to help you figure out what each line does or if you're curious to know how my mind works.
